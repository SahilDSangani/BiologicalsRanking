You are my research assistant. I want you to perform a deep, multi-stage, EXHAUSTIVE web research and evidence collection process about one company.

The company name for this query is: **{{Nufarm Americas Inc.}}**

Your task is to perform a thorough, multi-pass web search — far deeper than a basic Google search — to collect, categorize, and verify ALL publicly available documents related to the company’s biological agriculture products.

---------------------------------------------------------
CRITICAL EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS (READ CAREFULLY):
---------------------------------------------------------

- You MUST search exhaustively.
- You may NOT stop after finding a “reasonable sample.”
- You may NOT cap results per category.
- You MUST continue searching each category until diminishing returns are reached and no NEW documents can be found using additional query variations.
- If a category plausibly contains dozens of documents, you are expected to find dozens.
- Stopping early is considered an incorrect result.

You MUST perform multiple iterative search passes per category, expanding queries, sources, keywords, and file types each time.

You are NOT allowed to summarize or select “representative” documents.
You are required to enumerate ALL discoverable documents that meet the criteria.

---------------------------------------------------------
SCOPE OF PRODUCTS TO INCLUDE (VERY IMPORTANT):
---------------------------------------------------------

Only include documents that relate to the company’s:

- Bio-fertilizers
- Bio-stimulants
- Bio-controls (biopesticides, bioprotectants)

Additional rules:
- If a product is unrelated (e.g., chemical pesticides, cleaning agents, non-agricultural bio products), exclude it.
- If a product is somewhat related (e.g., soil microbes, inoculants, microbial blends, biological amendments), include it.
- If unsure, include it but clearly state why.
- Each document must be placed in EXACTLY one category below.
- Do NOT fabricate anything. Only include documents that truly exist and provide a working URL.

---------------------------------------------------------
CATEGORIES YOU MUST COLLECT AND CATEGORIZE:
---------------------------------------------------------

A. Research Reports
This category combines ALL of the following into a single level:
- Company-authored white papers or technical briefs
- Peer-reviewed academic or journal articles
- Independent research reports by universities, extension services, government agencies, agronomists, consultants, or third-party research organizations

Any document that presents experimental data, trials, evaluations, scientific analysis, or performance results related to the company’s biological ag products belongs here.

B. Lab Reports
Controlled laboratory experiments or analytical testing that mention or evaluate the company’s biological products.

C. Field Reports
On-farm, greenhouse, or field trial results involving the company’s biological ag products.

D. Testimonials
Customer, grower, distributor, or partner testimonials that directly describe experiences using the company’s biological products.

E. News Articles
Press releases, trade publication articles, industry news, announcements, or media coverage related to the company’s biological products.

F. User Reviews
Unstructured or informal user feedback from ANY platform, including but not limited to:
- Google Reviews
- Reddit
- Forums
- X (Twitter)
- LinkedIn
- Facebook
- YouTube comments
- Agricultural product review sites

---------------------------------------------------------
MANDATORY SEARCH STRATEGY (NO SKIPPING):
---------------------------------------------------------

For EACH category, you MUST:

1. Perform multiple query iterations using:
- Company name variations
- Product names
- Active ingredients
- Microbial strains
- Biological formulations
- Trial-related keywords (e.g., “trial,” “study,” “evaluation,” “results,” “efficacy”)
- Filetype searches (PDF, DOC, PPT, XLS)
- Site-restricted searches (e.g., site:.edu, site:.gov, site:companydomain)

2. Search across ALL of the following:
- General search engines
- Company website and ALL subdomains
- PDF repositories and document archives
- University and extension program websites
- Government agriculture and regulatory sites
- Academic databases
- Industry news and trade publications
- Distributors, resellers, and partners
- Archived and cached web pages
- Social media platforms and forums

3. Continue expanding searches until:
- New queries no longer return NEW documents
- Results begin to repeat previously collected sources

---------------------------------------------------------
OUTPUT FORMAT:
---------------------------------------------------------

For each category, provide:

1. A bold header:
Category X – [Name] – Total Found: N

2. A table with the following columns:
- Title
- Link
- Source Type (PDF, webpage, academic paper, etc.)
- Why it belongs in this category (one sentence)

3. If a category has ZERO items, explicitly state:
“No items found after exhaustive multi-pass search.”

---------------------------------------------------------
FINAL SUMMARY REQUIREMENT:
---------------------------------------------------------

After all categories, provide a summary table with:
- Category
- Count
